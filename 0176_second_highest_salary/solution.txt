Approach 1: Using sub-query and LIMIT clause

SELECT (SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM   employee
        ORDER  BY salary DESC
        LIMIT  1 offset 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;

Approach 2: Using IFNULL and LIMIT clause

SELECT Ifnull((SELECT DISTINCT salary
               FROM   employee
               ORDER  BY salary DESC
               LIMIT  1 offset 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
