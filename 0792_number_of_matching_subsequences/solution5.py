# Algorithm:
# - Begin by creating a default dictionary of 'list' objects. The main benefit of a default dictionary is that when 
#   you access an entry that does not yet exist, the entry is created automatically (in this case, the value for 
#   the entry is an empty list when it is created). 
# - Create a 'count' variable to keep track of the number of words that are subsequences of the given string.
# - Populate dictionary with all the words in the list of words. The key for each entry is the first letter of the 
#   word. The value is the list of words that start with that letter. Using the example in the problem, the 
#   dictionary would look like the following:
#   {'a': ['a', 'acd', 'ace'], 'b': ['bb']}
# - The next step is to iterate through each character in the given string. 
#   For each character, I access the dictionary to retrieve the list of words that start with that character. 
#   Reset the value of the entry to an empty list and then iterate through the list of words I retrieved. 
#   -   If the word is only a single letter, then I conclude that we have successfully found a completed 
#       subsequence and increase our 'count' by one. 
#   -   Otherwise, slice off the first character and add the sliced word back to the dictionary. This time, it is 
#       added to the entry for which the key is equal to the first letter of the sliced word.
# - This process continues until we have iterated through all characters in the string. At the end, return count.
