# Approach #1: Depth-First Search (Recursive) [Accepted]

# Intuition and Algorithm:
# We want to know the area of each connected shape in the grid, then take the maximum of these.
# If we are on a land square and explore every square connected to it 4-directionally (and recursively squares 
# connected to those squares, and so on), then the total number of squares explored will be the area of that 
# connected shape.
# To ensure we don't count squares in a shape more than once, let's use seen to keep track of squares we haven't 
# visited before. It will also prevent us from counting the same shape more than once.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(R âˆ— C), where R is the number of rows in the given grid, and C is the number of columns. We 
# visit every square once.
# Space complexity : O(R âˆ— C), the space used by seen to keep track of visited squares, and the space used by the 
# call stack during our recursion.
