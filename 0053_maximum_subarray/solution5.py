# Approach 3: Divide and Conquer (Advanced - hard to understand - go with solution3.py)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/solution/

# Intuition:
# This approach is slower than the second approach and uses more space, it uses recursion 
# Divide and conquer algorithms involve splitting up the input into smaller chunks until they're small enough to 
# be easily solved, and then combining the solutions to get the final overall solution.

# If we were to split our input in half, then logically the optimal subarray either:
# - Uses elements only from the left side
# - Uses elements only from the right side
# - Uses a combination of elements from both the left and right side

# Thus, the answer is simply the largest of:
# - The maximum subarray contained only in the left side
# - The maximum subarray contained only in the right side
# - The maximum subarray that can use elements from both sides

# Finding the maximum subarray from the left and right half is straightforward - just recurse using the respective 
# half of the array. So, the hard part is figuring out how to find the best subarray that uses elements from both 
# sides. 
# Lets use a smaller example, nums = [5, -2, 1, -3, 4, -2, 1]. 
# Since we want to use elements from both sides, we also must use the middle element, -3. Now, we can also take 
# from the left and the right, but every element must be connected to the middle (since we're still forming a 
# subarray).
# The fact that every element must be connected to the middle actually makes our lives a lot easier - every 
# subarray we consider must contain the element immediately beside the center, which means there are only as many 
# subarrays as there are elements. In our example, the right side is [4, -2, 1]. There are only 3 subarrays to 
# consider - [4], [4, -2], and [4, -2, 1]. To find the best chain of elements we can take from a half, iterate 
# from the middle to the end (start of the array for the left half) and continuously update some counter curr.
# (check example animation)

# Algorithm:
# Now that we know how to find the best subarray containing elements from both sides of any given array, the 
# algorithm is as follows:
# 1. Define a helper function that we will use for recursion.
#   -   This function will take an input left and right, which defines the bounds of the array. The return value 
#       of this function will be the best possible subarray for the array that fits between left and right.
#   -   If left > right, we have an empty array. Return negative infinity.
#   -   Find the midpoint of our array. This is (left + right) / 2, rounded down. Using this midpoint, find the 
#       best possible subarray that uses elements from both sides of the array with the algorithm detailed in 
#       the animation above.
#   -   The best subarray using elements from both sides is only 1 of 3 possibilities. We still need to find the 
#       best subarray using only the left or right halves. So, call this function again, once with the left half, 
#       and once with the right half.
#   -   Return the largest of the 3 values - the best left half sum, the best right half sum, and the best 
#       combined sum.
# 2. Call our helper function with the entire input array (left = 0, right = length - 1). This is our final 
#       answer, so return it.
