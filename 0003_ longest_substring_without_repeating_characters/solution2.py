# Approach 2: Sliding Window

# Neetcode: https://youtu.be/wiGpQwVHdE0

# Intuition:
# Given a substring with a fixed end index in the string, maintain a HashMap to record the frequency of each 
# character in the current substring. If any character occurs more than once, drop the leftmost characters until 
# there are no duplicate characters.

# Algorithm:
# In the naive approaches, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate character. But it is
# unnecessary.
# If a substring s_{ij}, from index i to jâˆ’1 is already checked to have no duplicate characters. We only need
# to check if s[j] is already in the substring s_{ij}
# Solution: 
# We use HashSet to store the characters in current window [i, j) (j = i initially). Then we slide
# the index j to the right. If it is not in the HashSet, we slide j further. Doing so until s[j] is already
# in the HashSet.
# At this point, we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters start with index i.
# If we do this for all i, we get our answer.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(2n) = O(n). In the worst case each character will be visited twice by i and j.
# Space complexity : O(min(m, n)). Same as the previous approach. We need O(k) space for the sliding window, where 
# k is the size of the Set. The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the 
# charset/alphabet m.
