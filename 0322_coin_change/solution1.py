# Approach #1 (Brute force) [Time Limit Exceeded]
# https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/solution/ (video)

# Algorithm:
# The algorithm uses backtracking technique to generate all combinations of coin frequencies. It makes a sum of 
# the combinations and returns their minimum or âˆ’1 in case there is no acceptable combination.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(S^n). S is the amount and n is the number of denominations.
# In the worst case, complexity is exponential in the number of the coins n. The reason is that every coin 
# denomination c_i could have at most S/(c_i) values. Therefore the number of possible combinations is :
# S^n / ( (c_1) * (c_2) ... (c_n))
# Space Complexity : O(S). In the worst case the maximum depth of recursion (maximum height of the tree) can be
# S, since the solution can take 'amount' coins of denomination 1 (or the lowest denomination amount in the list).
