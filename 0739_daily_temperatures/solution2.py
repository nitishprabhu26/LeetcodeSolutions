# Approach 2: Using Stack(stack will be in monotonic decreasing order)

#  A monotonic stack is simply a stack where the elements are always in sorted order.

# Complexity analysis:

# Time complexity : O(n).
# At first glance, it may look like the time complexity of this algorithm should be O(N^2), because there is a nested while loop inside 
# the for loop. However, each element can only be added to the stack once, which means the stack is limited to N pops. Every iteration 
# of the while loop uses 1 pop, which means the while loop will not iterate more than N times in total, across all iterations of the 
# for loop.
# An easier way to think about this is that in the worst case, every element will be pushed and popped once. This gives a time 
# complexity of O(N)O(2â‹…N)=O(N).

# Space complexity : O(n).
# If the input was non-increasing, then no element would ever be popped from the stack, and the stack would grow to a size of N elements 
# at the end.
# Note: answer does not count towards the space complexity because space used for the output format does not count.
