# Approach 1: Brute Force (Time Limit exceeded)
# Algorithm:
# In this case, we will simply consider the area for every possible pair of the lines and find out the maximum area out of those.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(n^2). Calculating area for all n.(nâˆ’1)/2 height pairs.
# Space complexity : O(1). Constant extra space is used.
