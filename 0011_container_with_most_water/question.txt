You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints 
of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). 
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most 
water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area 
of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16

Example 4:
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
