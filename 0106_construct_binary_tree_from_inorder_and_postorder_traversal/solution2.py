# Approach 1: Recursion

# For preorder traversal the first value is a root, then its left child, then its right child, etc. 
# For postorder traversal the last value is a root, then its right child, then its left child, etc.

# Algorithm:
# Build hashmap value -> its index for inorder traversal.
# Return helper function which takes as the arguments the left and right boundaries for the current subtree 
# in the inorder traversal. These boundaries are used only to check if the subtree is empty or not. Here is 
# how it works helper(in_left = 0, in_right = n - 1):
# - If in_left > in_right, the subtree is empty, return None.
# - Pick the last element in postorder traversal as a root.
# - Root value has index in the inorder traversal, elements from in_left to index - 1 belong to the left 
#   subtree, and elements from index + 1 to in_right belong to the right subtree.
# - Following the postorder logic, proceed recursively first to construct the right subtree 
#   helper(index + 1, in_right) and then to construct the left subtree helper(in_left, index - 1).
# - Return root.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Let N be the length of the input arrays.

# Time complexity : O(N).
# Building the hashmap takes O(N) time, as there are N nodes to add, and adding items to a hashmap has a 
# cost of O(1), so we get O(N)â‹…O(1)=O(N).
# Building the tree also takes O(N) time. The recursive helper method has a cost of O(1) for each call 
# (it has no loops), and it is called once for each of the N nodes, giving a total of O(N).
# Taking both into consideration, the time complexity is O(N).
# Space complexity : O(N).
# Building the hashmap and storing the entire tree each requires O(N) memory. The size of the implicit 
# system stack used by recursion calls depends on the height of the tree, which is O(N) in the worst case 
# and O(logN) on average. Taking both into consideration, the space complexity is O(N).
