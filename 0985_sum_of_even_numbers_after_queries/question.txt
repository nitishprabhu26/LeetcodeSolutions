You are given an integer array 'nums' and an array 'queries' where queries[i] = [val_i, index_i].
For each query i, first, apply nums[index_i] = nums[index_i] + val_i, then print the sum of the even values 
of nums.
Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the i_th query.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to nums[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to nums[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to nums[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to nums[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], queries = [[4,0]]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
1 <= queries.length <= 10^4
-10^4 <= val_i <= 10^4
0 <= index_i < nums.length
