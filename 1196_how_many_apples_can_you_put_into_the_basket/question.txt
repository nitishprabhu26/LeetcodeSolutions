You have some apples and a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.

Given an integer array weight where weight[i] is the weight of the ith apple, return the maximum number of apples 
you can put in the basket.

Example 1:
Input: weight = [100,200,150,1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.

Example 2:
Input: weight = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]
Output: 5
Explanation: The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose any 5 of them.
 

Constraints:
1 <= weight.length <= 10^3
1 <= weight[i] <= 10^3
