# Approach #2 (One-pass)
# Algorithm:
# We can greatly improve on the brute-force approach by keeping two indices i1 and i2 where we store the most 
# recent locations of word1 and word2. Each time we find a new occurrence of one of the words, we do not need to 
# search the entire array for the other word, since we already have the index of its most recent occurrence.

# Complexity analysis:
# Time complexity : O(Nâ‹…M) where N is the number of words in the input list, and M is the total length of two 
# input words.
# Space complexity : O(1), since no additional space is used.
