# Your BrowserHistory object will be instantiated and called as such:
homepage = 'https://www.google.com'
url1 = 'https://github.com/'
url2 = 'https://leetcode.com/'
url3 = 'https://www.youtube.com/'
obj = BrowserHistory(homepage)
obj.visit(url1)
obj.visit(url2)

# Complexity Analysis:
# Let's assume here, n visit calls are made, m is the maximum number of steps to go forward or back, and l is 
# the maximum length of the URL string.
# Time complexity: 
#   -   In the visit(url) method, we insert the URL string in our array and update the current pointer, both of 
#       these operations will take O(1) time each.
#       Thus, in the worst case each call to the visit(url) method will take O(1) time.
#   -   In the back(steps) and forward(steps) methods, we directly return the element at the required index 
#       which takes O(1) time.
#       Thus, in the worst case, each call to these methods will take O(1) time.
# Space complexity:
#   -   We might visit n URL strings and they will be stored in our array.
#   -   Thus, in the worse case, we use O(lâ‹…n) space.
