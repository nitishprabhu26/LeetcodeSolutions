# Approach 2: Regex

# Algorithm:

# The pattern of case 1 in regex is [A-Z]*, 
# where [Aâˆ’Z] matches one char from 'A' to 'Z', 
# * represents repeat the pattern before it at least 0 times. 
# Therefore, this pattern represents "All capital".

# The pattern of case 2 in regex is [a-z]*, 
# where similarly, [a-z] matches one char from 'a' to 'z'. 
# Therefore, this pattern represents "All not capital".

# Similarly, the pattern of case 3 in regex is [A-Z][a-z]*.

# Take these three pattern together, we have [A-Z]* | [a-z]* | [A-Z][a-z]* 
# where "|" represents "or".
# Still, we can combine case 2 and case 3, and we get .[a-z]*, where "." can matches any char.

# Therefore, the final pattern is [A-Z]* | .[a-z]*

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(N), but depends on implementation.
# However, it is worth pointing out that the speed of regex is highly dependent on its pattern and its 
# implementation, and the time complexity can vary from O(1) to O(2^n). If you want to control the speed 
# yourself, using Approach 1 would be better.
# Space complexity : O(1). We only need constant spaces to store our variables.
