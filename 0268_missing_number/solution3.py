# Approach #2 HashSet [Accepted]

# Algorithm:
# This algorithm is almost identical to the brute force approach, except we first insert each element of nums into 
# a set, allowing us to later query for containment in O(1) time

                return number

# Complexity Analysis
# Time complexity : O(n). 
# Because the set allows for O(1) containment queries, the main loop runs in O(n) time. Creating num_set costs 
# O(n) time, as each set insertion runs in amortized O(1) time, so the overall runtime is O(n+n) = O(n).
# Space complexity : O(n).
# nums contains nâˆ’1 distinct elements, so it costs O(n) space to store a set containing all of them.
