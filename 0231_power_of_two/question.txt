Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2^x.

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 2^0 = 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 2^4 = 16

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: false
 

Constraints:
-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
