# Approach 1: Simple Counting

# Intuition:
# Go through every cell on the grid and whenever you are at cell 1 (land cell), look for surrounding (UP, RIGHT, 
# DOWN, LEFT) cells. A land cell without any surrounding land cell will have a perimeter of 4. Subtract 1 for each 
# surrounding land cell.
# When you are at cell 0 (water cell), you don't need to do anything. Just proceed to another cell.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(m.n) where m is the number of rows of the grid and n is the number of columns of the grid. 
# Since two for loops go through all the cells on the grid, for a two-dimensional grid of size m√ón, the algorithm 
# would have to check m.n cells.
# Space Complexity: O(1). Only the result variable is updated and there is no other space requirement.
