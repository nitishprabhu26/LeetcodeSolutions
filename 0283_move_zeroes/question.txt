Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order 
of the non-zero elements.
Note: You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.


Example 1:
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
