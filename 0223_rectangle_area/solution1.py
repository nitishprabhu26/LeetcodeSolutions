# Overview:
# In this problem, we are given the coordinates of four points on a 2D plane. Two of them belong to the bottom 
# left, and top right corners of rectangle A, and the other two belong to the bottom left and top right corners 
# of rectangle B. The sides of the rectangles are parallel to the x and y axes. Using these points, we need to 
# find the total area covered by two rectangles.


# Approach: Math and Geometry

# Intuition:
# Calculating the individual areas of both rectangles is easy enough. We have the coordinates of bottom left and 
# top right corners - (x1, y1) and (x2,y2). In this case, the area of the rectangle would be height âˆ— width or in 
# other words, (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1). We can calculate the area of both rectangles and sum it together.
# But, the rectangles could potentially have an overlap between them. This means we might be counting the 
# overlapping area twice, which should have been added only once. So, to get the final answer, we need to subtract 
# the overlapping area from the total area.

# Finding the overlap:
# To find the overlap, we need to find the width and height of the overlapping area (if there is any). We can get 
# the width by finding the overlap in the horizontal or x direction. height can be calculated by finding the 
# overlap in the y direction.
# To find the x overlap, let's think about the projection made by the corners of the rectangles on the x-axis. In 
# other words, draw a line perpendicular to the x-axis from both rectangles' bottom left and top right corners. 
# We mark the points at which these lines meet the x-axis. We can see that these points create two line segments - 
# one formed by (ax1,0),(ax2,0), and the other one formed by (bx1,0),(bx2,0).
# Now, finding x overlap is equivalent to finding the intersection of these two line segments.

# From the images(img3 and img4), we can see that if there is an overlap, min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1) will be a 
# positive quantity equal to the x overlap of the two rectangles. If the amount is negative or 0, there is no 
# overlap between the two lines (and rectangles).
# xOverlap = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)
# In a similar way, we can find the y overlap of the two rectangles.
# yOverlap = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)
# The area of the overlap overlap = xOverlap * yOverlap.
# The total area considering the overlap between the two rectangles:
# area = areaA + areaB - overlap

# Algorithm:
# 1. We are given four points - ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2 and bx1, by1, bx2, by2.
# 2. Calculate areaA and areaB by multiplying width and height of the respective rectangles.
# 3. Calculate the x overlap:
#       xOverlap = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)
# 4. Calculate the y overlap:
#       yOverlap = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)
# 5. If xOverlap and yOverlap, both are positive, multiply x and y overlaps to get the area of the overlap. 
#    Otherwise, it is 0.
# 6. Calculate the total area as - areaA + areaB - overlap.
# 7. Return the total area.

# Complexity analysis:
# Time complexity : O(1). Given the coordinates of rectangles' corners, calculating the areas of each individual 
# rectangle and the overlap can be considered a constant time operation. So the final time complexity is O(1).
# Space complexity : O(1). We don't make use of any external data structure for this question. So, space 
# requirements can be considered constant. So the final space complexity is O(1).
