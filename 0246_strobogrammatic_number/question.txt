Given a string num which represents an integer, return true if num is a strobogrammatic number.
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).


Example 1:
Input: num = "69"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: num = "88"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: num = "962"
Output: false
 

Constraints:
1 <= num.length <= 50
num consists of only digits.
num does not contain any leading zeros except for zero itself.
