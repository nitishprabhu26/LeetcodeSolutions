# Approach 2: Seen-Maximums Set

# Intuition:

# In the previous approach, we deleted the maximum and second maximum so that we could easily find the third 
# maximum. We had to convert the input Array into a Set so that duplicates weren't super complicated to handle.
# Instead of deleting items though, we could instead keep a Set of maximums we've already seen. Then when we are 
# searching for a maximum, we can ignore any values that are already in the seen Set.
# This will also handle duplicates elegantlyâ€”if for example we had the input set [12, 12, 4, 2, 12, 1], then the 
# first value we'd put into the seen maximums Set would be 12. Then when we find the second maximum, the algorithm
# knows to ignore all the 12s.

# Complexity Analysis:

# Time Complexity : O(n).
# For each of the three times we find the next maximum, we need to perform an O(n) scan. Because there are only, 
# at most, three scans the total time complexity is just O(n).
# The Set operations are all O(1) because there are only at most 3 items in the Set.
# Space Complexity : O(1).
# Because seenMaximums can contain at most 3 items, the space complexity is only O(1).
