# Approach 2: Doubly Linked List
# https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/solution/

# Time to implement DLL MyLinkedList, which is a much faster (twice faster on the testcase set here) though a bit 
# more complex. It contains size, sentinel head and sentinel tail.
# Note, that sentinel head and tail are always present.

# Add at Index, Add at Head and Add at Tail:
# The idea is simple:
# - Find the predecessor and the successor of the node to insert. If the node is to be inserted at head, its 
#   predecessor is a sentinel head. If the node is to be inserted at tail, its successor is a sentinel tail. 
#   (Use bidirectional search to perform faster).
# - Insert the node by changing the links to the next and previous nodes.
# to_add.prev = pred
# to_add.next = succ
# pred.next = to_add
# succ.prev = to_add

# Delete at Index:
# Basically, the same as insert:
# - Find the predecessor and successor.
# - Delete node by changing the links to the next and previous nodes.
# pred.next = succ
# succ.prev = pred

# Get:
# Get is very straightforward:
# - Compare index and size - index to define the fastest way: starting from the head, or starting from the tail.
# - Go to the wanted node.
# # choose the fastest way: to move from the head
# # or to move from the tail
# if index + 1 < self.size - index:
#     curr = self.head
#     for _ in range(index + 1):
#         curr = curr.next
# else:
#     curr = self.tail
#     for _ in range(self.size - index):
#         curr = curr.prev

# Time complexity : O(1) for addAtHead and addAtTail. O(min(k, Nâˆ’k)) for get, addAtIndex, and deleteAtIndex, where

# Space complexity : O(1) for all operations.
