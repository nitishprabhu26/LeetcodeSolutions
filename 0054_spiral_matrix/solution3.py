# Approach 2: Mark Visited Elements

# Intuition
# If we mark the cells that we have visited, then when we run into a visited cell, we know we need to turn.

# How do we know which direction we need to turn to? We always follow this loop: right, down, left, up, right 
# again, and so on. Therefore, when we run into a cell that we have visited, we can simply turn to the next 
# direction in the aforementioned loop.

# Note that elements in the matrix are constrained to -100 <= matrix[row][col] <= 100, therefore we can select 
# a number that is out of this range to mark it i.e. 101 is selected for marking purposes.

# If we reach the visited cell, we need to turn. However, when we meet another visited cell immediately after 
# changing the direction, it means we reached the last element in the matrix.


# Algorithm

# Initializations:
#     - Initialize a 2D array directions to represent the four directions that we will move.
#     - Initialize currentDirection to 0 to signify that we are moving right at the beginning.
#     - Initialize VISITED to 101 to mark visited cells.
#     - Initialize changeDirection to 0.
#     - Initialize row and col to 0 since our initial position is (0, 0).
# We follow the current direction until we reach the matrix boundaries or a visited cell.
#     - While traversing in the current direction, remember to reset changeDirection to 0 at every step.
#     - Move to the next cell by updating the row and column indices.
#     - Append the element to the result and mark the location as visited.
# Update the direction and changeDirection. If changeDirection is larger than 1, it means we are continuously 
# changing our directions, and therefore we've visited all of the elements.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Let M be the number of rows and N be the number of columns.
# Time complexity : O(M.N). This is because we visit each element once.
# Space complexity : O(1). This is because we don't use other data structures. Remember that we don't include 
# the output array in the space complexity. 
# However, if we were prohibited from mutating the input matrix, then this would be an O(Mâ‹…N) space solution.
# This is because we would need to use a boolean matrix to track all of the previously seen cells.
