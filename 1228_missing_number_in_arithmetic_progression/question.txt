In some array arr, the values were in arithmetic progression: the values arr[i + 1] - arr[i] are all equal for 
every 0 <= i < arr.length - 1.
A value from arr was removed that was not the first or last value in the array.
Given arr, return the removed value.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [5,7,11,13]
Output: 9
Explanation: The previous array was [5,7,9,11,13].

Example 2:
Input: arr = [15,13,12]
Output: 14
Explanation: The previous array was [15,14,13,12].
 

Constraints:
3 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
The given array is guaranteed to be a valid array.
