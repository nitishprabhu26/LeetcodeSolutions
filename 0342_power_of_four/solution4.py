# Approach 3: Bit Manipulation
# https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/solution/ (check images)

# Let's first check if num is a power of two: x > 0 and x & (x - 1) == 0.
# Now the problem is to distinguish between even powers of two (when x is a power of four) and odd powers of 
# two (when x is not a power of four). In binary representation both cases are single 1-bit followed by zeros.
# What is the difference? 
# In the first case (power of four), 1-bit is at even position: bit 0, bit 2, bit 4, etc. 
# In the second case, at odd position.
# Hence power of four would make a zero in a bitwise AND with number (101010...10)_2:
# 4^a âˆ§ (101010...10)_2 == 0
