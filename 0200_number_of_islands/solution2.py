# Approach #2: BFS [Accepted]

# Algorithm:
# Linear scan the 2d grid map, if a node contains a '1', then it is a root node that triggers a Breadth First 
# Search. Put it into a queue and set its value as '0' to mark as visited node. Iteratively search the neighbors 
# of enqueued nodes until the queue becomes empty.

# Complexity analysis:
# Time complexity : O(M Ã— N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
# Space complexity :  O(min(M, N)) because in worst case where the grid is filled with lands, the size of queue 
# can grow up to min(M,N).
