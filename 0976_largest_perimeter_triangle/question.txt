Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three 
of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:
3 <= nums.length <= 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
