# Approach 2: Left-to-Right Pass Improved:
# Instead of viewing a Roman Numeral as having 7 unique symbols, we could instead view it as having 13 unique symbols
# â€” some of length-1 and some of length-2.

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Let's hard-code a mapping with the value of each symbol so that we can easily look them up.

        total = 0
        i=0

        while i < len(s):
            # if at least 2 symbols remaining AND s.substing(i, i + 1) is in values:
            # or s[slice(i,i+2)]
            if i+1<len(s) and s[i:i+2] in values:
                total += values.get(s[i:i+2])
                i += 2
            else:
                total += values.get(s[i:i+1])
                i+=1
        return total
