# Approach 2: O(1) Space, Efficient Solution
# Intuition:
# Rather than using additional variables to keep track of rows and columns to be reset, we use the matrix itself as the indicators.

# The idea is that we can use the first cell of every row and column as a flag. This flag would determine whether a row or column has 
# been set to zero. This means for every cell instead of going to M+N cells and setting it to zero we just set the flag in two cells.

# if cell[i][j] == 0 {
#     cell[i][0] = 0
#     cell[0][j] = 0
# }

# These flags are used later to update the matrix. If the first cell of a row is set to zero this means the row should be marked zero. 
# If the first cell of a column is set to zero this means the column should be marked zero.
