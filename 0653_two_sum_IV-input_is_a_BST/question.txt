Given the root of a Binary Search Tree and a target number k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST 
such that their sum is equal to the given target.

 
Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
-10^5 <= k <= 10^5
