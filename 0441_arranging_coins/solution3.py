# Approach 1: Binary Search
# OR
# Neetcode: https://youtu.be/5rHz_6s2Buw


# Naive approach might run out of time when the input becomes too large. 
# Assume that the answer is k, i.e. we've managed to complete k rows of coins. These completed rows contain in 
# total 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2 coins

# We could now reformulate the problem as follows:
# Find the maximum k such that, k(k+1)/2 â‰¤ N.
