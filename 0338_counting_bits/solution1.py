# Solve the problem for one number at a time.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(n.logn),For each integer x, in the worst case, we need to perform O(logn) operations,
# since the number of bits in x equals to logx + 1 and all the bits can be equal to 1. However, on average,
# each bit will be set n/2 times, so for each integer x, we will perform log(x)/2 operations, therefore,
# in total, it will cost O(nâ‹…log(n)/2) operations.
# Space Complexity: O(1). Since the output array does not count towards the space complexity.
