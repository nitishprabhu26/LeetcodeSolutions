# Approach 1: Brute Force

# Algorithm:
# We loop over the array, checking each element in turn. If we find it, we return true. Otherwise, if we reach the 
# end of the nested for loop without returning, we return false.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(n.m). Becase we perform a constant time operation for each element of an n Ã— m element matrix,
# the overall time complexity is equal to the size of the matrix.
# Space complexity : O(1). The brute force approach does not allocate more additional space than a handful of 
# pointers, so the memory footprint is constant.
