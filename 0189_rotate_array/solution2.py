# Approach 1: Brute Force [Time Limit Exceeded]
# The simplest approach is to rotate all the elements of the array in k steps by rotating the elements by 1 unit 
# in each step.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity: O(n√ók). All the numbers are shifted by one step(O(n)), k times.
# Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.
