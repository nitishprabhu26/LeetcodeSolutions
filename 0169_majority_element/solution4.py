# Approach 4: Randomization

# Intuition:
# Because more than [n/2] array indices are occupied by the majority element, a random array index is likely to 
# contain the majority element.

# Algorithm:
# Because a given index is likely to have the majority element, we can just select a random index, check whether 
# its value is the majority element, return if it is, and repeat if it is not. The algorithm is verifiably correct 
# because we ensure that the randomly chosen value is the majority element before ever returning.
