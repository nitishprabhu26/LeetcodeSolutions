# Approach #1 Brute Force [Accepted]

# If a string with an even length is a palindrome, every character in the string must always occur an even number 
# of times. If the string with an odd length is a palindrome, every character except one of the characters must 
# always occur an even number of times. Thus, in case of a palindrome, the number of characters with odd number of 
# occurrences can't exceed 1(1 in case of odd length and 0 in case of even length).

# The given string could contain almost all the ASCII characters from 0 to 127. Thus, we iterate over all the 
# characters from 0 to 127. For every character chosen, we again iterate over the given string s and find the 
# number of occurrences, ch, of the current character in s. We also keep a track of the number of characters in 
# the given string s with odd number of occurrences in a variable count.

# If, for any character currently considered, its corresponding count, ch, happens to be odd, we increment the 
# value of count, to reflect the same. In case of even value of ch for any character, the count remains unchanged.

# If, for any character, the count becomes greater than 1, it indicates that the given string s can't lead to the 
# formation of a palindromic permutation based on the reasoning discussed above. But, if the value of count remains 
# lesser than 2 even when all the possible characters have been considered, it indicates that a palindromic 
# permutation can be formed from the given string s.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity : O(n). We iterate constant number of times (128) over the string s of length n, 
# i.e. O(128 â‹… n) = O(n).
# Space complexity : O(1). Constant extra space is used.
