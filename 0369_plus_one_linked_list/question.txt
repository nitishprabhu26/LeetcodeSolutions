Given a non-negative integer represented as a linked list of digits, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]

Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The number represented by the linked list does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
